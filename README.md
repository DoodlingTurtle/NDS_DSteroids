# DSteroids
A Nintendo DS homebrew game based on "Asteroids".

This project makes use of libNDS, as well as a modified version of GL2D.

## The Plan
The idea is, to make a Asteroids game, that will allow the player to purchase "Upgrades" for there ship in between levels.
The upgrades are partially randomized, allowing for each run to turn out slightly different.

## Current features
- Remapable controls
- Endless gamemode

# TODO
- Implement saves
  - For the highscore 
  - For the controller config
  - (Maybe a qucksave mode, to pause the current run.)
  
- Add music and sound
- Implement the ship upgrades
- Add more game mechanics to balance the game
  - Timer to count down the score
    (the longer the player takes to complete the level, the less points they will get)
    
  - Cooldown for shots 
    (the cooldown can be reduced via upgrade purchases)
