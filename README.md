# DSteroids
A Nintendo DS homebrew game based on "Asteroids".

This Project makes use of libNDS as well as a modified version of GL2D.

## The Plan
The Idea is, to make a Asteroids game, that will allow you to purchase "Upgrades" for your ship in between levels.
The upgrades are partially rendomized, allowing for each run to turn out slightly different.

## Current features
- Remapable controlls
- Endless gamemode

# TODO
- Implement saves
  - For the highscore 
  - For the controller config
- Add Music and Sound
- Implement the Ship Upgrades
- Add more gamemechanics to balance the game
  - timer to count down the score
    (the longer the player takes to complete the level, the less points they will get)
    
  - cooldown for shots 
    (the cooldown can be reduced via upgrade purchase)
